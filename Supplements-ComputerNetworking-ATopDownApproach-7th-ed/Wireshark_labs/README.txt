We ask that you DO NOT POST THESE SOLUTIONS ON A WEB SITE THAT IS NOT PASSWORD PROTECTED!  If you post these solutions, the students of other professors will be able to find the solutions by simply Goggle'ing the question, and find the answer on your site.  You wouldn't want your students getting the answer to the labs that you assign in this way, would you?  Of course not.  So please (please, please, please) help all instructors, and do not post any solutions on Web site that is not password protected. Thanks!

And of course if you have any questions or comments about the labs, find bugs, have suggestions for improvements, etc? we would very much like to hear from you.
